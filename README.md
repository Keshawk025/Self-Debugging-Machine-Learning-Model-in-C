# Self-Debugging-Machine-Learning-Model-in-C
This project implements a self-debugging machine learning model in C. It trains a linear regression model using gradient descent and monitors loss behavior during training to detect divergence and unstable learning. Automatic warnings and suggestions improve training reliability.
